# Julia Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia when handling negative numbers in mathematical functions. The function `myfunction` is designed to return the square of a number, but it unexpectedly returns a negative value for negative inputs due to operator precedence. 

The solution demonstrates how to correctly compute the square of a number, regardless of its sign, using parentheses for proper operator precedence.
